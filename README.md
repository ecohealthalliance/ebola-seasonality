# Seasonality of Ecobola in Bangladesh Bat populations

This is a repo for EHA work on modeling the seasonality of ebola in Bangladesh.
Current focus is:

-   Using current serology data to describe seasonality in bats
-   Parameterizing and simulating an SIR model

# Project organization:

-  The group has an EHA slack channel: `#ebola-seasonality`
-  The folder is shared as a [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7x6gumn8sajrzgi/AACM3TVHtgEVpJcVl47q_Meka?dl=0).
   Parts of it are under version control on a private [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/ebola-circulation)

## File organization

-  `notebook`: Short analyses, drafts and write-ups (preferred format 
   markdown/R-markdown and R scripts)
-  `data`:  Raw data, not to be modified directly.  If you place something in 
   this folder, please put a description with appropirate links and metadata in 
   that folder's `README.md` file.
-   `R` contains code that is re-used in multiple analyses, such as data-loading
    and cleaning functions.
-  `papers`:  PDFs of relevant papers, and eventually a store of citations for 
   write-ups
- `inst`: Other write-ups and relevant documents for review
