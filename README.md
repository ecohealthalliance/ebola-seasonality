# Seasonality of Ecobola in Bangladesh Bat populations

This is a repo for EHA work on modeling the seasonality of ebola in Bangladesh.
Current focus is:

-   Using current 
-   Understanding how camel trade influences MERS dynamics
-   Evaluating whether MERS is sustainable in camel populations or requires
    repreated spill-over from another reservoir to be maintained

# Project organization:

-  The group has an EHA slack channel: `#ebola-seasonality`
-  The folder is shared as a [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7x6gumn8sajrzgi/AACM3TVHtgEVpJcVl47q_Meka?dl=0).
   Parts of it are under version control on a private [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/ebola-circulation)
